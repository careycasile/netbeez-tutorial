# Overview
**NetBeez** is a distributed network monitoring platform. The monitoring is performed from multiple points via hardware, software, and cloud agents, called *Beez*.  The agents are managed by a server, called the *Beezkeeper*, which is also located on-premise or in the cloud. 

## Dashboard
The dashboard is the graphical user interface that is necessary to manage the agents, create monitoring tests, troubleshoot network or application problems, and receive alerts and reports.  The Dashboard runs on a dedicated server, called BeezKeeper.
