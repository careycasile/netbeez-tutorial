The NetBeez server is the main component of the solution. The BeezKeeper is responsible for managing the agents, storing the data received by the agents, generating alerts, incidents, and notifications. The BeezKeeper can be hosted on premises as a virtual appliance or in the cloud, managed by either NetBeez (AWS) or by the customer itself (AWS, Azure, etc.). The amount of CPU, RAM, and disk space required to run the server varies depending on the number of agents managed and the number of tests running. Please consult the online documentation for more details on [server requirements](https://netbeez.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031332291).
