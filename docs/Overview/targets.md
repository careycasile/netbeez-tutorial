## Targets
A target is a web application or TCP-based service that is monitored by one or more agents running real-time tests such as ping, DNS, HTTP, traceroute and path analysis. A target is defined by one or more resources, which are defined by IP address, Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), or URL. Each resource has its own assigned tests and alert profiles. Weâ€™ll talk more about targets in the [Monitoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsIWkWI3mMj2xqG0Ce_1BNrb8t8RhePK_bokT24sjo4/edit#heading=h.f8ca4ozijm9s) section of this tutorial.
